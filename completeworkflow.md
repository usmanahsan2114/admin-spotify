# Development Workflow Progress

## Step 1 – Project Initialization and Setup
- Scaffolded a Vite React (TypeScript) frontend and installed Material UI, React Router, and Recharts.
- Established base directories for components, pages, and services and added a thematic placeholder screen.
- Initialized an Express backend with JSON parsing, CORS support, and a root health check endpoint.
- Configured root-level npm scripts (with concurrently) to run frontend and backend development servers.
